Hi, my name is Dick Wolff

I'm a (full stack) software engineer and IT architect, currently working at Info Support. My passion is front-end development (the touchy-feely stuff), but I also like to do backend development to shake things up.

Since 2015 I've grown fond of motor racing. I started watching Formula 1 a lot, and have since diversified my motor racing interest into other categories (like the F1 Feeder series, F2), IndyCar and WEC.

In 2018 I discovered I liked traveling and hiking, like a lot! Since then I've been planning trips all over the world.

On this blog you'll find stuff that interests me and of which I want to share my experiences.
